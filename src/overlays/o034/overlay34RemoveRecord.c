/* Matched 2026-09-12, lane p9-tight. Twelve words to zero. The plateau's
 * `shadow` local was an artefact: the four `move $a1,$v1` the old handoff was
 * trying to buy are the post-decrement temp of `while (remaining--)`, emitted
 * once in each loop's guarded entry and once at each rotated loop top, and
 * they are one web. A source-level `shadow` cannot join that web because the
 * two ranges overlap -- `shadow` is live to the call while the temp is live to
 * the bottom test -- so every spelling of the copy gave the temp its own
 * register. Deleting `shadow` and writing both loops as `while (remaining--)`
 * puts the temp in $a1 and reproduces all four copies for free; the condition
 * must be bare, since `remaining-- != 0` materialises a boolean and emits
 * `sltu` where the target has `move`. overlay34FreeReloc therefore takes one
 * argument: $a1 at the call is this dead temp, not a second parameter. */
