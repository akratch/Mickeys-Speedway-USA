/* Matched 2026-09-12, lane p9-tight. Sixteen words to zero, two edits in the
 * tail, both named below at the point of use.
 *
 * 1. The `result = entry;` self-copy in the else arm. It is the whole of the
 *    ten register words: uopt propagates `result` into every use of `entry`
 *    after the copy, so the ActiveHead store, the `entry->next = 0` store and
 *    the final ActiveTail store all read $v0 where the ROM reads $s0.
 * 2. `return entry;` inside the guard with a bare `return 0;` after it,
 *    instead of `else { entry = 0; } return entry;`. That is what puts the
 *    `move $v0, $zero` in the branch-likely's delay slot and leaves the dead
 *    copy the ROM carries at the join; the shared-exit form sets $s0 there
 *    instead and needs two more instructions to get back to $v0.
 *
 * Neither edit works alone: the reshape on its own is 22 words (recorded by the
 * 2026-09-04 probe as 74/96) and the self-copy on its own is 6.
