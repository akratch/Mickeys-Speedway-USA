/* Matched by deleting every local that held an element address or an element
 * index, and spelling all six store groups -- the chain node, the eight image
 * nodes and the three text rows -- through the array subscript of the counter
 * global itself.
 *
 * A uopt live range is formed per IR name (L131), so `&D_340[D_1CC]` written
 * on both sides of a call is ONE range whose hull spans the call, and a
 * pointer or index LOCAL is a symbol, which is coloured from the procedure's
 * table or given a stack home and is never a ring temporary.  That is what
 * held the earlier shapes apart from the shipped code in two ways at once.
 * Writing `D_340[D_1CC].field` instead gives, per element:
 *   - one range for the address expression, pre-call and post-call, so both
 *     occurrences take the one caller-saved colour the shipped code uses;
 *   - one range for the counter load, spanning all three rows, which is what
 *     takes the callee-saved register the earlier shapes gave to the address;
 *   - and the pre-call read of the counter lands in a ring temporary instead
 *     of a coloured symbol, which is the ring draw (L129) the index-local
 *     shapes were missing -- they ran a FIFO position behind from the head of
 *     the text region onward.
 * Measured on this function: index locals everywhere 179, one row reverted to
 * the direct read 155, all rows direct but the post-call stores still through
 * a shared index local 165, no locals at all 98.
 *
 * The remaining 98 were two statement orders, both of which had to be
 * re-climbed because a statement-order optimum is not portable across a shape
 * change (L59: each group is one physical line, so as1's `lineno` tie is
 * retired and the raw ready-list order supplies the reversal):
 *   - the image node's post-call group wants the handle store FIRST, ahead of
 *     the two old-link reads: 98 -> 26.  The earlier 630-order exhaustion was
 *     an optimum of the pointer-local shape and does not survive this one.
 *   - the second root header's nine geometry stores want width, height, mode,
 *     x, colour, colour, y, then the two values: 26 -> 0.
 *
 * All four siblings in this cluster take the identical edit at 0 words. */
