/* Ownership: the shared builder BSS (+0x0..+0xFD0) is defined by the F571C TU;

/* 158 -> 0, lane p10-o101 2026-09-12, on the lever that closed the rest of
 * this overlay's builder family, and the residual was never four separate
 * problems -- it was one carrier.
 * L145 -- DELETE EVERY LOCAL THAT HELD AN ELEMENT ADDRESS OR AN ELEMENT INDEX.
 *   `index`, `node32` and `node24` are gone and every store is spelled through
 *   the array subscript of the counter global itself. A uopt live range is
 *   formed per IR name (L131), so the subscript written on both sides of the
 *   call is ONE range spanning it, and both occurrences take the caller-saved
 *   colour the shipped code uses; the counter read becomes its own range on the
 *   callee-saved register the index local used to hold; and the pre-call read
 *   lands in a ring temporary, which a local can never be (L130). The bump
 *   moves to the end of its group, since the stores now read the counter
 *   rather than a captured address. 158 -> 2 at size delta 0.
 * L146 -- every field order this file carried was an optimum of the carrier
 *   shape and none of them survives it. All four text rows take the declared
 *   field order now, one physical line each, including the two that had been
 *   expanded one statement per line and the one that carried a scrambled
 *   colour order; the two root headers likewise. The only order that is not
 *   the declared one is in the sprite node, where color13 precedes value18,
 *   and that single swap is the last 2 words. A dependence-respecting climb
 *   over all four groups with the call held as a barrier reaches 0 and a
 *   second round is flat. */
