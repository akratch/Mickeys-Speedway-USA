/* Two source-shape levers took this from 263 masked words to 222; the frame,
 * the size and the whole callee-saved ladder were already exact.
 *
 * L59 -- the four non-macro assignment groups are ONE physical line each. as1
 *   minimises (start_time, -aftercycles, -latency, addr, lineno, ready-list
 *   position); with a group's stores on separate lines `lineno` decides and
 *   emits them in source order, while the ROM emits each group reversed.
 *   Folding retires the key and the raw ready-list order supplies the reversal.
 *   Worth 27 words on its own: 263 to 236, structural 57 to 28, and the first
 *   thirty-three instructions go byte-exact.
 * L110/L115 -- the FIRST node group reads the pool counter inline,
 *   `node32 = &D_340[D_1CC]`, and only the post-call half names the index
 *   local. The ROM puts that pre-call read in a scratch register and the
 *   post-call one in the counter's callee-saved home; giving both the same
 *   local forces one web across both and mis-colours the pre-call half.
 *   Worth a further 13 words, and it is specific to the first group: the same
 *   change inside the image macro regresses to 297 and inside the text macro
 *   to 364.
 *
 * Refuted here, each measured against the folded 236 baseline. The
 *   call-spanning edit that closed the missing sixth web on the F78F4
 *   quadruplet -- storing handle, previousType and previous through the
 *   pre-call pointer -- is a REGRESSION on this function (305 for all three
 *   moved, 242 for handle alone, 248 for the other two), because this
 *   function's ladder already homes nine slots and there is no web to win.
 *   The L100 counter partition likewise does not pay: splitting the node and
 *   text counters reads 346, the F63F8 shape (owner+text in one local, node in
 *   another) 383, one local for all three 283, and giving the owner counter
 *   its own local 236, against 236 for the incumbent.
 * Measured inert: the x/y store order in the first node group once the pool
 *   read is inline.
 * Remaining: size, frame and the s0..s8 slot map are all exact; 178 of the 222
 *   are register naming and, by L114, almost all of it is ugen ring phase
 *   rather than colour -- the instrumented uopt shows every remaining split
 *   web preferring a caller-saved colour, so no missing web is left to win. */
/* Matched 2026-09-12 by lane p9-o101, 222 -> 29 -> 0, with the lever that
 * closed the four 2,100-byte builders in this overlay: DELETE EVERY LOCAL THAT
 * HELD AN ELEMENT ADDRESS OR AN ELEMENT INDEX and spell each store through the
 * array subscript of the counter global itself.
 *
 * A uopt live range is formed per IR name (L131), so `D_340[D_1CC]` written on
 * both sides of a call is ONE range spanning the call and both occurrences take
 * the caller-saved colour the shipped code uses; the counter load becomes its
 * own range covering every element and takes the callee-saved register the
 * index local used to hold; and the pre-call counter read lands in a ring
 * temporary rather than a coloured symbol, which is the free ring draw of L129.
 * A local reaches none of the three, because a local is a symbol and a symbol is
 * never a ring temporary (L130). That single edit is worth 222 -> 29 here.
 *
 * The counter bump moves to the end of each group as part of the edit: without
 * the pointer local the stores read the counter rather than a captured address,
 * so the bump can no longer sit early. That is semantics, not schedule.
 *
 * The last 29 were statement order, re-climbed from scratch because a
 * statement-order optimum is never portable across a shape change -- the four
 * one-line groups and the two macros, hill-climbed under the read-before-write
 * dependences with each call held as a barrier. A second round is flat. */
