/* Three source-shape levers took this function from 296 masked words to 203.
 * L59 -- every per-element assignment group is ONE physical line. as1 minimises
 *   (start_time, -aftercycles, -latency, addr, lineno, list position); with a
 *   group's stores on separate lines `lineno` is the deciding key and orders them
 *   in source order, while the ROM emits that group reversed. Folding the group
 *   retires the key, the raw list order supplies the reversal, and the prologue
 *   goes byte-exact.
 * L100/L115 -- the counter locals are partitioned, not shared. `index` carries the
 *   panel-order counter D_1C4 and the text-row counter D_1D0. That is what puts
 *   `index` in the ROM's callee-saved home with the ROM's save placement.
 * L115/L101 -- the two node blocks read their counter global directly in the
 *   pointer expression, on BOTH sides of the call, and the `slot` local is gone.
 *   This is the same mechanism the F78F4 quadruplet needed and it does two
 *   different things here at once. The pre-call counter read stops being a
 *   globalcolor web and becomes a ugen ring temp, which is what the ROM has --
 *   `lw t5,0(s3)`, `sll t6,t5,0x5`, `addu s0,s4,t6` go byte-exact and the first
 *   mismatch moves from +0x8C to +0x9C -- and because both definitions of the
 *   node pointer are now the same symbol expression, the pointer keeps the ROM's
 *   callee-saved s0 instead of splitting into two caller-saved webs. The
 *   post-call counter then takes the ROM's a1. Worth 213 to 203 and the naming
 *   bucket 167 to 104. Doing only half of it is worse than either: pre-call only
 *   reads 215 because the node pointer splits, post-call only reads 314.
 * The counter bump must stay in front of every store. `D_1CC = D_1CC + 1`
 *   immediately after the pointer expression reuses the load; placed behind any
 *   store it makes uopt re-read the counter, at one extra load per block.
 * L114, corrected for this procedure, and it is per procedure. Do NOT classify a
 *   naming row by register bank here. This procedure's own p1cost rows decode as
 *   c2 v1, c4 a1, c5 a2, c6 a3, c7 t0, c8 t1, c9 t2, c10 t3, c11 t4, c12 t5,
 *   c13 unnamed, c14-c22 s0-s8, and globalcolor really does assign three t-bank
 *   colours in this compilation (two webs to c7 t0, one to c8 t1) alongside 22
 *   webs it declines to ugen. So "t-bank means ring phase" is false here. What
 *   makes the lever above work is narrower and measured: t5, the register the
 *   pre-call counter needs, is NOT among the colours globalcolor assigns, so
 *   that value has to reach the ring, and the direct counter read is what puts
 *   it there. A later lane must re-decode the table from its own procedure's
 *   records rather than inherit this one.
 * Measured inert: declaration order, `register`, the local's type, statement
 *   order inside the text-row macro, and dropping the now-unused `slot`
 *   declaration (L99).
 * Measured regressive: splitting the counter per block or per call side, and
 *   moving the opacity store later.
 * The byte-length local is `u8`, not `s32`, and the callee is declared `s32`
 *   rather than `s8`. Worth 203 to 136, the largest single lever on the
 *   function, and semantically exact rather than lucky: both uses already
 *   truncate to eight bits -- the node field is `u8` and the opacity expression
 *   masks with 0xFF -- so the declaration only states what the code already
 *   guarantees. A 360-cell lattice over the callee's return type, the local's
 *   type, the store cast and the opacity mask puts every floor cell at LOCAL
 *   `u8`, with the return type indifferent across all six spellings.
 * The counter-bump STORE, which this comment used to name as the next lever, is
 *   exhausted. 659 constrained permutations of the whole post-call block -- the
 *   bump, the three node stores and the two root stores under their two real
 *   dependences -- across four bump spellings, all flat, measured on the
 *   identical F000512C sibling. The reading that the axis is not statement
 *   order holds, now over the whole block rather than six statements. The block
 *   order was re-measured after the type lever and the adopted form is still
 *   the floor, so it is not a stale plateau.
 * The no-op paragraph that used to close this comment is answered below, and it
 *   was right that L127 does not reach the residual -- the lever wanted is the
 *   opposite one. */
/* 130 -> 99 -> 0. Lane p9-o101 took this family to 99 by deleting every local
 * that held an element address or an element index and spelling each store
 * through the array subscript of the counter global itself (L131: the subscript
 * written on both sides of a call is ONE IR name, so it is one range and both
 * occurrences take the caller-saved colour the shipped code uses, while the
 * counter read becomes its own range on the callee-saved register and the
 * pre-call read lands in a ring temporary -- L130, a local is a symbol and a
 * symbol is never a ring temporary). The counter bump moves to the end of its
 * group as part of that edit, because the stores then read the counter instead
 * of a captured address. Every statement order was re-climbed afterwards, since
 * a statement-order optimum belongs to the shape and not to the function (L146).
 *
 * The last 99 were the four text rows, and they were ONE COUNT. ugen drew
 * sixteen integer ring temporaries per row where the shipped code draws fifteen,
 * so the phase ran one position ahead and fell one further behind per row --
 * row 1 ours t6 against t5, then t4, t3, t2. The instrumented ugen's
 * DKWB-FREELIST records name every draw with its source line, and the extra one
 * was the second of two masks: with the length local declared `u8`, reading it
 * already emits a mask of the call result, so `(u32)(length & 0xFF)` masks
 * twice and ugen draws a ring temporary for each, after which as1's peephole
 * folds the pair into the single `andi` the object shows. The draw is spent but
 * the instruction is gone, which is why no register census could see the cause,
 * and why 155 L127 no-op cells measured on this family were all flat -- a no-op
 * CONSUMES a ring temporary and this residual needed one FEWER. Deleting the
 * redundant mask is semantically exact, since a `u8` is already inside 0xFF,
 * and it spends fifteen draws per row: every register in the text rows lands,
 * the first mismatch moves four words later, and what is left is schedule alone.
 *
 * That schedule was one statement move. `.kind = 4` belongs between `.color3`
 * and `.text`, which is where the four 2,100-byte builders in this overlay
 * already had it; on the two-mask shape the same move read 103, so it is L146
 * twice over. Walking the kind store across the macro on the one-mask shape
 * reads 20, 5, 4, 3, 2, 0, 28, 27, 123 from just after `.opacity` back to its
 * old place -- a single clean optimum at 0. Size delta 0, frame 0x38, and the
 * identical two edits close all three 1,520-byte siblings.
 * Lane p10-o101, 2026-09-12. */
