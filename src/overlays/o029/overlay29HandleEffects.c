/* Exact size (1028 bytes / 257 words), exact 0x48 frame, all 22 relocation
 * offsets and types.  253 of 257 words agree and the four that do not are one
 * fact: the CSE web for `verticalAngle + 0x2000` -- defined in the second
 * block, spilled to the compiler temp at sp+0x2C and reloaded by the third and
 * fourth -- takes `v0` here and `a2` in the target.  The four words are
 * +0x13C, +0x148, +0x150 and +0x164, which is exactly that web's load, add,
 * store and spill; its temp slot, its schedule, its spill point and every
 * other register in the function agree.  ugen emits the register itself
 * (`addu $2, $2, 8192` in its listing), so this is ugen's allocation, not a
 * scheduling artefact of as1.
 *
 * The declaration list is closed on both sides.  A sixth local costs 22 words
 * at best in any of six positions and any of seven types -- the frame law is
 * frame = align8(below + S) with below = 0x38 and S = 0x10, so 0x48 admits
 * exactly these five.  The obvious composition -- drop `state` to make room,
 * then name the shared value -- does not work either: the named carrier is
 * free, but spelling `object->state` at its six uses is nine words SHORTER
 * (248/257), so `state` is load-bearing as a local and the list cannot be
 * traded.  That closes the L88 "name the value to add a pool colour" route.
 *
 * The double mask in the first block is load-bearing: a single `& 0xFFFFU`, a
 * `(u16)` cast or no mask at all is 72 words, first difference +0x30.  It
 * costs no instruction (ugen emits a bare `addu $t3, $2, 12288`), so it is a
 * pure web-structure edit.  Both `volatile` casts in INITIALIZE_RECORD are
 * load-bearing at eight words each.
 *
 * What is exhausted, all flat at four words.  Earlier lanes: statement order
 * and record placement across all four blocks (3,888); physical line grouping
 * within and across blocks (1,203); mask spelling per block (1,110); macro
 * body order (576); the record-pointer spelling lattice (256); local and
 * prototype types (163); inner-block scope placement and declaration
 * permutation (136); `register` hints and a sixth local (50); naming the
 * shared value (48); signature return type and extra parameters (12); the
 * driver flag lattice (13 -- `-Wab,-r4300_mul` confirmed).  Added here: all
 * 4,096 identity-operation forms of the three `verticalAngle + 0x2000` sites
 * (`^ 0`, `| 0`, `+ 0`, `- 0`, `* 1`, `-(-x)`, `(s16)`, `(u16)`, single and
 * double mask, reversed operands), of which 1,868 keep the size and every one
 * scores four; all 721 statement orders of block 2; the `angles` array
 * respelled as a two-field struct with either field order and three argument
 * spellings; a 96-cell prototype lattice over the four relocated callees'
 * return and parameter types; and per-phase optimisation levels through
 * `ido-phases.py` (uopt/ugen/as1 at -O3, uopt at -O1).
 *
 * The one genuinely new fact is a reachability bound.  A 4,000-point
 * randomised cross of macro body order, both `volatile` casts, and the mask
 * spelling of all five angle expressions moves this carrier to `v0` (2,745
 * cells), `v1` (603), `t6` (250), `t7` (177), `t5` (107), `t8` (82) and `t9`
 * (29) -- and never once to `a0`-`a3`, at any score.  The 96-cell prototype
 * lattice and the 721 statement orders are also uniformly `v0`.  So the
 * target's `a2` is not in this candidate's reachable allocation set: the next
 * lever has to change the allocation regime, not the spelling or the
 * schedule.  Note the permuter is not usable here -- its scratch scores this
 * body 135 against a measured 4. */
