/* Matched 2026-09-12, lane p9-tight. Fifteen words to zero, two edits.
 *
 * 1. The `object` field was `volatile`, which gives the reloads AND as1's
 *    scheduling edges [L144]; the target needs only the reloads. Taking the
 *    address at each of the four reads keeps all four loads -- the count is
 *    observable, the ROM has four -- and drops the edges, and the entry block
 *    then collapses from a mixed structure/schedule/register residual (15) to
 *    a pure schedule one (9, category schedule-only, the instruction multiset
 *    already exact). Every prior probe on this function held the `volatile`
 *    fixed and asked which statement order would reach the target's stream;
 *    with the edges in place no order can, which is why eight positions of the
 *    source assignment measured 15 to 22 and never below.
 * 2. With the edges gone the order is the lever, and it is the natural one:
 *    the two pointer producers first, then position x/y/z, then offset x/y/z.
 *    Measured over all 1,120 interleavings that keep position and offset each
 *    in x/y/z order, with the contact and source assignments at every
 *    position: exactly two score 0, this one and the mirror with `source`
 *    ahead of `contact`; the next best is 2 and the median is 12.
 *
 * The prior closure's named decision variable -- uopt's web-creation order in
 * the entry block -- was the wrong level. The block is one basic block, so
 * every one of those forms produced the same webs; what differed was as1's
 * scheduling, and the volatile edges were holding it fixed.
