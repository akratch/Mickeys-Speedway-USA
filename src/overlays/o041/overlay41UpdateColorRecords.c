/* Matched 2026-09-12, lane p9-tight. Fifteen words to zero, and the four
 * `initial*` locals were never there: the target's snapshot is a RE-READ of
 * the record field, which uopt common-subexpressions back to the first load,
 * so the load lands in the CSE temp and the working value is the copy. Both
 * the plateau's direction (load into the working local, copy into the
 * snapshot) and its mirror put the load and the copy in the wrong groups, and
 * no colour reachable from either closes it -- the plateau measured 15 and the
 * mirror 25.
 *
 * Read off an instrumented uopt whose object is byte-identical to the
 * configured build. On the plateau body the four working webs take v1/t0/t1/s2
 * at save 20 and the four snapshot webs a1/a2/a3/t2 at save 10, and `remaining`
 * at save 15 lands between them and steals $a0. Forcing `remaining` to c9 and
 * the snapshots to c3-c6 is accepted and scores 8, not 0, which is how the
 * load/copy half was separated from the colour half: the colour was worth 7
 * and the group membership 8, and only a source change reaches the second.
 * With the re-read the CSE temp is its own web and both halves fall together.
 *
 * The 0x80000000 `lui` and the four direct-write `sb` displacements carry
 * relocations in the extracted target and literals here; they are masked, and
 * `promotion-proof` covers the linked identity. */
