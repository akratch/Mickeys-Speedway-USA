# Cleanup queue: matched functions awaiting a more natural C form

Policy (user, 2026-08-27): when a match is only reachable via a non-idiomatic /
"looks fake" C form (a permuter-forced spelling — `do{}while(0)` boundaries,
`^ 0`, `if (1)`, `[x = 0]` index side-effects, redundant temps for register
pressure), **commit the working match now** with an in-source comment noting the
form is inert, and record it here. Return later to find a cleaner C that produces
the same bytes. These are byte-identical matches with **no fakes and no
ROM-derived content** — only the *spelling* is unnatural.

A match here is DONE for scoreboard purposes; the cleanup is a quality follow-up,
not a correctness gap.

| Function | TU | Non-natural form | Notes for the cleaner pass |
|---|---|---|---|
| `func_80046AA8` | diCpu | `do{}while(0)` around the setup block | The boundary forces IDO to close the setup as its own basic block before the blit loop. A cleaner equivalent (a real early computation dependency?) may exist. |
| `func_800320F0` | runlink | four inert allocation aids: one `overlayCount` block and three `if (1) {}` blocks | The blocks preserve the exact long-lived-register allocation found by the bounded permuter. Seek a natural declaration/lifetime spelling with the same 101 words and 21 relocations. |
| `func_overlay_014_F00009F4_18702CC` | overlay 14 asset loader | inert `if (1) {}` around the relocation loop | The boundary preserves the exact pool allocation found by the annotated-target permuter; seek a natural loop/lifetime spelling. |
| `overlay1UpdateValueCache` | overlay 1 value cache | algebraically zero `remaining * 0` return | The live counter read preserves IDO's exact caller-saved web. Seek a natural zero return with the same 120 words and two local relocation pairs. |
| `overlay59DrawFrame` | overlay 59 frame renderer | empty duplicated `!index` condition | The inert condition preserves the exact entry/owner register order. Seek a natural declaration or lifetime spelling with the same 76 words and relocation surface. |

Add rows as ugly-but-verified matches land. When revisiting: reproduce the match
with idiomatic C, `gmake verify`, then delete the row + the in-source comment.
